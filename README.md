# tictactoe

It was tough to come up with ways to make tic tac toe look cool.
Integrated Google fonts to give the X O characters a more digital look. Used chalk background texture make a shoutout to elementary school roots.

Future Goals:
I'm planning on making a reset/start over button to clear the values. If time permits I may check of it's possible to enable sound effects with the "on.click"
